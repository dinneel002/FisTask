What is preferred by us
Include negative tests wherever possible in your demo
Data and logic should be separate and extensible. Well designed DRY coding practice.
We prefer selenium with python
Deliver the code via GIT link
There is no time limit for the assignment, but we will consider the time spent in the assessment.
Whatâ€™s next
Presentation of demo and code design review, Addition of minor changes during demo
On successful completion, further technical rounds will be scheduled.
